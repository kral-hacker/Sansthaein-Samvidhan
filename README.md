Developed a website aimed at simplifying key sections of the Indian Constitution (Part 5 and 6) through interactive gamification techniques, including situation-based stories, flowcharts, and timelines.
Created multiple games and engaging stories to make the Constitution more accessible and easier to understand for a wide audience.
Enabled multilingual support, allowing the website to be translated into various languages, with audio versions of the stories available in three languages to assist visually impaired users.
Integrated a chatbot for user assistance and engagement, enhancing accessibility and interaction across the platform.
